# Digital Banking Mock

Full demo with a **Spring Boot backend** and a **static frontend** proxied via Nginx.  
Shows a simple login, transfer endpoint and an in-memory ledger.

## Run
```bash
docker compose up --build
# Frontend: http://localhost:8082
# API:      http://localhost:8081/api
```

> Minimal demo to showcase architecture & integration. Expand with Angular/React when needed.
